/*
lets start with var keyword; var is a function , global & local lexical scope , this means that it can be accessed from any place in the document and also it's hoisted and initialised a value of undefined .
let can be reassigned a value , const is abbreviation for a constant variable declaration , so from it's name it's a constant variable , that can never be reassigned again , both let and const are block scoped meaning that {
const x = 0
} => both let and const , their scope is inside the curly brackets they can't access any scope rather than curly brackets scope
also let and const both are hoisted but not initialzised a value meaning that they go to the top of the document with out being initialised a value .
also let and const are introduced in es6 2015 . 
i.e it's better to use const for declaring a variable if you know in the bottom of your mind that the value will be a constant value , if you are not sure , please use let as it can be reassigned .
